# 🏥 Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)

An AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that assists healthcare professionals by analyzing medical reports using Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). The system summarizes clinical reports, extracts important medical information, predicts possible diseases, recommends precautions and treatments, and performs medication safety checks.

# Modules

## 1. Medical Report Summarization

Summarizes lengthy clinical reports into concise, easy-to-read summaries using transformer-based models such as BART or T5.

---

## 2. Clinical Information Extraction

Extracts important medical entities including:

- Symptoms
- Diseases
- Medications
- Patient history
- Laboratory findings
- Vital signs

---

## 3. Disease Prediction

Predicts likely diseases using structured clinical information extracted from reports.

Possible models include:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Artificial Neural Networks
- LSTM

---

## 4. Recommendation Engine

Generates:

- Precautions
- Lifestyle recommendations
- Treatment suggestions

based on predicted diseases.

---

## 5. Drug Safety Checker

Checks for:

- Drug interactions
- Drug side effects
- Medication warnings

---
